## FOIA Modernization

This is the main repository for [18F's](https://18f.gsa.gov) FOIA modernization
effort. 

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants the public the right to access
records from the federal government. 

Our work is one of number of
[commitments](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/us_national_action_plan_6p.pdf)
towards the modernization of FOIA. 

We use the [issues](https://github.com/18f/foia/issues) for project-wide
discussions. 

Additional news can be found on 18F's website:
[18f.gsa.gov/tags/foia](http://18f.gsa.gov/tags/foia).

Our primary focus right now is working on
[foia-hub](https://github.com/18F/foia-hub). FOIA Hub is an online tool to
guide users to up-to-date FOIA contact and request information across the
federal government. 

This repository also contains the [bulk
data](https://github.com/18F/foia/tree/master/contacts/data)  that powers FOIA
Hub.
