## Project FOIA

This repo is for project-wide [discussion](https://github.com/18f/foia/issues) for 18F's FOIA modernization team. It also provides some scratch space for miscellaneous research, data, scrapers, etc.

For the vast majority of our public-facing work, see the [foia-hub](https://github.com/18F/foia-hub) repository. It's a starting place for filing a Freedom of Information Act request with the US federal government. It's built in Django, using a Postgres backend.
