description: The Marine Mammal Commission provides independent, science-based oversight
  of domestic and international policies and actions of federal agencies addressing
  human impacts on marine mammals and their ecosystems. Our mission is largely driven
  by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The MMPA was enacted in October 1972
  in partial response to growing concerns among scientists and the general public
  that certain species and populations of marine mammals were in danger of extinction
  or depletion as a result of human activities. The MMPA set forth a national policy
  to prevent marine mammal species and population stocks from diminishing beyond the
  point at which they cease to be significant functioning elements of the ecosystems
  of which they are a part.
