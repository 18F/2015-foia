description: 'The Presidio Trust is an innovative federal agency created to save the
  Presidio and transform it into a new kind of national park.


  Spanning 1,500 acres in a spectacular setting at the Golden Gate, the Presidio now
  operates largely without taxpayer support, is home to a large community of residents
  and commercial tenants, and offers unique recreation, hospitality, and educational
  opportunities to people throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and the world.? Established
  in 1996 through the ground-breaking and bipartisan Presidio Trust Act, the agency??
  ?is managed by a seven member board of directors.


  The Presidio Trust operates with a partnership approach? that brings together individuals
  and organizations across sectors to generate public benefit. Our key partners are
  the National Park Service and the non-profit Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.'
