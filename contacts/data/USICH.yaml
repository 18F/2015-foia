description: 'USICH was originally authorized by Congress through Title II of the
  landmark Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 (PL 100-77) to serve
  as an ?independent establishment? within the executive branch. We were charged with
  coordinating the federal response to homelessness and creating a national partnership
  at every level of government and with the private sector to reduce and end homelessness
  in the nation while maximizing the effectiveness of the federal government in contributing
  to the end of homelessness.


  The agency was most recently reauthorized by the Homeless Emergency Assistance and
  Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009.'
