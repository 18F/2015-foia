description: 'The Commission´s primary mission is to regulate gaming activities on
  Indian lands for the purpose of shielding Indian tribes from organized crime and
  other corrupting influences; to ensure that Indian tribes are the primary beneficiaries
  of gaming revenue; and to assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly by
  both operators and players.


  To achieve these goals, the Commission is authorized to conduct investigations;
  undertake enforcement actions, including the issuance of notices of violation, assessment
  of civil fines, and/or issuance of closure orders; conduct background investigations;
  conduct audits; and review and approve Tribal gaming ordinances.'
