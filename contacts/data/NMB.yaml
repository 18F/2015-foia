description: The National Mediation Board (NMB), established by the 1934 amendments
  to the Railway Labor Act of 1926, is an independent agency that performs a central
  role in facilitating harmonious labor-management relations within two of the nation's
  key transportation modes--the railroads and airlines. Pursuant to the Railway Labor
  Act, NMB programs provide an integrated dispute resolution process to effectively
  meet the statutory objective of minimizing work stoppages in the airline and railroad
  industries.
