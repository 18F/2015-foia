description: The Surface Transportation Board (STB) was created in the ICC Termination
  Act of 1995 and is the successor agency to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The
  STB is an economic regulatory agency that Congress charged with resolving railroad
  rate and service disputes and reviewing proposed railroad mergers. The STB is decisionally
  independent, although it is administratively affiliated with the Department of Transportation.
