description: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent
  agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials
  for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment
  are protected. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses
  of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection
  and enforcement of its requirements
